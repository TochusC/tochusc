As a junior about to graduate with no rank, ~~no competitions~~ (national first place ✔️), no publications, I’m on the edge of the top 20% 🥹.

~~In a superposition state of striving for both examination and recommendation for exemption⚡~~ (confirmed for exemption 🌟).

I’m now fully committed to securing a better graduate offer 🎓.

Mentally stable ✨

-⚡ Background: In just half a year, I went from uncertainty about the exemption quota to scoring near full marks in multiple courses, improving my rank by nearly 10 places (Mobile Internet Practice: 98, Compilation Principle Course Project: 99, Computer Operating Systems: 97…), and then clinching the national first prize in July. I’ve turned the tide; now with a confirmed exemption quota, I’m giving my all for the future.
